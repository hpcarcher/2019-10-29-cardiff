## Spreadsheets and OpenRefine

### The good

* OpenRefine seems useful.
* Good session. If implemented on LanSchool, it would be easier to see the process in our own system along with the projector.
* The coloured notes are really useful to assess the progress of the group. Really good content, very relevant for research and very satisfied with the explanations. Very friendly teachers. Files easy to access.
* Trainer went through everything nice & slowly  and made sure everyone understood before moving on. The software was explained before going into how to use it. Felt free to ask questions &ndash; Good to have extra helpers in addition to trainer.
* Refine. Data Cleaning Fast. Auto save. Easy clustering & updating data.
* OpenRefine looks like an useful tool.
* The course is engaging and interesting. I am learning new things.
* OpenRefine seems like a very useful tool and it was demonstrated quite well.
* Good resources. Helpful tasks. Generally good explanations. Essential stuff for my research &ndash; very applicable.
* The pace of the workshop is really good. It's easy to keep up. The group is small enough to get help very quickly. So far very informative. The online lessons are planned very well!!
* Really interesting package. Great introduction.
* Understanding to slightly late arrival! Good to do exercises and follow along &ndash; interactive. OpenRefine useful resource have not come across in past.
* Shown how to export to CSV from both Excel and OpenRefine. OpenRefine will be very useful, it was good to be shown how to use from import to export.
* Very straightforward response & reply the questions informative.
* Everything online and accessible 24/7 post workshop. Clear instructor/instructions.
* Quite thorough + informative.

### The bad

* Set-up could have been shorter, as could data org. &ndash; a bit too basic for some people.
* Nothing :-)
* Maybe there should be additional exercises for people who finish soon the first ones.
* A handout, or link to the PowerPoint presentation would be useful &rarr; I may have missed this.
* Refine: problems with version (not showing scatterplot).
* A quick how to guide of the basics would be good for OpenRefine. Info on "Data Organisation in Spreadsheets" very basic &ndash; could be shorter.
* Sometimes a bit slow-going, although aware need to allow time for everyone with differing levels of experience.
* Slightly too fast.
* Each step needs to be introduced and the use/purpose of the task explained: more context. Link the lesson teaching more to the online lesson documentation &rarr; i.e. better structure.
* I'm sure the Excel section was very helpful to some more inexperienced data processors, but it felt a lot needless / obvious / unnecessary and I didn't learn anything new here.
* Some of the example and problems could have been sped up. Bit more direction needed when given a task to do (especially the first table).
* Mix ability group means more advanced participants spend a lot of time waiting. As everything is online, is there a need for a physical course?
* A bit more follow examples.
* "Data organisation in spreadsheets" was quite basic.
* Spend more time looking the screens and if anyone follows you.

## R (first part)

### The good

* Please provide the keyboard shortcuts as PDF or share.
* It was good to have two speakers.
* Interactive aspect is good.
* Very good overview for R. Easy to follow. Very nice teachers. Exercises of increasing difficulty are well received.
* Excellent and really practical. Good challenges.
* Gives good fundamentals of searching data and extracting information required.
* The challenge answers were helpful.
* Very well paced and I enjoyed the conversations around the topics. I am enjoying the course and learning things, thank you.
* Way more introductory than I expected when signing up. Very good actually for a complete beginner but too basic for someone already using R.
* Very informative. Excellent lecturer.
* Thorough, but slow introduction, was expecting to get further through the course.
* Excellent content: great to get an understanding of R from first principles. Well-delivered: good pace, clear step-wise progression, terminology clear. Invaluable material.

### The bad

* Very slow introduction to R if you already have programming experience.
* Session too long.
* I could not see the board as didn't have glasses and became lost.
* More explanations of examples. Less of a "story" and more of a structured explanation.
* Presenter used specific language without clarifying their specific meaning first. Explanation of specific terms is not in "Basic" English but in language specific to R. Refer to point 1 above. Overran in time. At lunch, we were 30 min. ahead. Ended: 17:00.
* So much information for 2 days.
* A little slow for me and would prefer a bit more structure str().
* Happy.

## R (second part)

### The good

* Very useful content, especially tidyverse.
* Examples + creation of visuals using R.
* Probably the most useful session for me on data analysis and plots.
* Very useful course. Nice and helpful staff.
* Very useful going through data visualisation.

### The bad

* More time on challenges.
* Merge data from different files. Remove headings from file (ignore first "n" rows).
* More of an introduction to ggplot2 needed. Better breakdown of spread/gather. More examples would be useful.
* May have needed more time on spreading/gathering.
* It would be better if some extra information summarizing functions was provided (ex. for the uses of spread, summarise, filter, etc.).
* Over ran in time, didn't finish course notes.

## SQL

### The good

* Interactive challenges. Would like other workshops on advanced R + SQL.
* A nice introduction to SQLite and basic SQL syntax.
* Good pace. Finishing on time.
* Very simple search/sort tool.
* Thank you for the great course. The pace and content was great and the instructors were friendly, kind and very knowledgeable. Great course.

### The bad

* SQL not so relevant to my research/work. A lot of functions in SQL that were not covered equivalently in R; more comparisons between utilities would be helpful.
* Challenges maybe too simple.
* Could join or link the contents for instance: use refine to clean, use db to summarise, and use R to plot/display data. Suggest which tool to use depending on the task at hand, e.g. "Refine is better for...", "use DB for...", "use R for...".
* SQL was rushed. SQL more related to OpenRefine. Better to be taught on same day.
